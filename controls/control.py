         "Actions" are asynchronously created on several "Control" levels (each with its own execution priority and responsibility) as the system response to outside world provided by sensory data.
         "Actions" are synchronously processed by the "Actuators" based on the context they carrie, such is: Which Actuator can process, processing priority, ...
         "Actions" context also carrie when it was processed, with what result, how long did it took for consideration of another correcting Action/response.
